# ESP32-New-Year-Countdown-Timer

An ESP32-based New Year countdown timer that synchronizes time using NTP, displays the current time and countdown on a 16×2 LCD, and activates a buzzer and LED when the target time is reached. The project also includes a test mode for quickly verifying functionality without waiting for the actual New Year.

## Features

- **Wi-Fi time synchronization (NTP)** for accurate countdown timing  
- **16×2 LCD display**  
  - Current local time with tenths of a second  
  - Countdown to the target time in seconds  
- **Buzzer alerts**  
  - Beep interval increases as the countdown approaches zero  
- **LED indicator**  
  - Pulses in sync with buzzer beeps  
  - Stays ON after countdown completion  
- **Test mode**  
  - Triggered via a GPIO pin  
  - Starts a 5-second countdown for testing and demos  
- **Final event display**  
  - Shows “HAPPY NEW YEAR!”  
  - Long buzzer tone when countdown reaches zero  

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board  
- 16×2 LCD (HD44780 compatible, 4-bit mode)  
- Buzzer (active or passive)  
- LED with current-limiting resistor  
- Push button or jumper wire (for test mode)  
- Stable Wi-Fi connection  
- Breadboard and jumper wires  

## Pin Configuration

### LCD Connections

| LCD Pin | ESP32 GPIO |
|-------|------------|
| RS    | 13 |
| EN    | 33 |
| D4    | 14 |
| D5    | 27 |
| D6    | 26 |
| D7    | 25 |

### Other Connections

| Component | ESP32 GPIO |
|----------|------------|
| Buzzer   | 32 |
| LED      | 2 |
| Test Pin | 34 |

Note: GPIO 34 is input-only on the ESP32, making it suitable for the test trigger.

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support installed  
- Libraries used:  
  - `LiquidCrystal`  
  - `WiFi.h`  
  - `time.h`  

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository into your Arduino projects folder.  
2. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.  
3. Install required libraries if they are not already available.  
4. Edit the following variables in the code:  
   - `ssid` and `password`: your Wi-Fi credentials.  
   - `gmtOffset_sec`: adjust for your local time zone if needed.  
5. Connect the hardware according to the pin configuration.  
6. Upload the code to your ESP32.  
7. On boot, the ESP32 will connect to Wi-Fi, synchronize time via NTP, and start the countdown display.

## Target Time

The default target is set to:

- **January 1, 2026 – 00:00:00 (local time)**

You can change the target date and time by modifying the `setTarget2026()` function in the code.

## Test Mode

Test mode allows you to simulate the final countdown without waiting for the real target time.

- Pull **GPIO 34 HIGH** to activate test mode  
- A 5-second countdown begins  
- The LCD shows a test indicator  
- Buzzer and LED behavior match the real countdown  

This is useful for debugging, demonstrations, and verifying hardware connections.

## Notes

- Time synchronization waits until a valid NTP timestamp is received before starting.  
- Beep intervals become shorter as the countdown approaches zero.  
- Once the final event is triggered, it will not repeat unless the device is reset.
